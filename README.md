# Estimate_Kharif_Crop_production

Here I explore multiple aspects of Crop production in India. I perform the following
1) Explore the datasets, from data.gov.in, related to crop production in India (Refer to Data Exploration.ipynb)
2) Building a Model that estimates the Crop production in Kharif season in India (Refer to Estimate_Crop_Produce_Model.ipynb)
